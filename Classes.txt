Classes notes

They uses Class key word.
Classes uses extends key word to handle inheritance.
A constructor is a special method used to create Objects. It gets called when when you create an inheritance.
In Classes it is the method for initializing the object s property.

Methids are defined inside the class and outside the constructor because of organisation and readability, to keep the class defination clean and organised.
Prototype inheritance.
is it possible to define the methods inside the class constructor?

Superclass or supertype:
in function constructors we use prototypal inheritance to establish a relationship between a supertype and a child.
in classes we use the key word extends for inheritance.

so the key difference between the two is the syntax , 'super' keyword super() is used inside the subclass constructor to call the superclass constructor.
